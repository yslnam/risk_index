# Macro Risk Index
A repository containing an interactive data visualization project, Macro Risk Index, using conflict risk indicators. Also serves as a efficient EDA tool.

Project:
* Title: Macro Risk Index
* Purpose: By aggregating and visualizing research-standard datasets on conflict risk indicators, Macro Risk Index allows for efficient exploratory data analysis and reinvestigates econometric approaches to conflict forecasting.
* Description: Created a "quick and dirty" exploratory data analysis dashboard and an interactive map of risk indicators by country using leaflet. Developed a Shiny app to compile all interactive visualizations.
* Blog: "[Macro Risk Index: A Tool for Efficient Exploratory Data Analysis of Complex Datasets](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/macro-risk-index-a-tool-for-efficient-exploratory-data-analysis-of-complex-datasets/)," *NYC Data Science Academy*

Technical notes:
* Languages: R
* Format: R, R Markdown, R Shiny Server and UI
* Demonstrated skills: Cleaning, Wrangling, Processing, Analysis, Visualization
* Specialities: Shiny App
